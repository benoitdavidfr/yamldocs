      rdf:Statement:
        comment: The class of RDF statements.
      rdfs:Container:
        comment: a super-class of the RDF Container classes, i.e. rdf:Bag, rdf:Seq, rdf:Alt.
      rdf:Bag:
        comment: |
          The class of unordered containers.  
          Whilst formally it is no different from an rdf:Seq or an rdf:Alt, the rdf:Bag class is used conventionally
          to indicate to a human reader that the container is intended to be unordered.
        subclassOf: rdfs:Container
      rdf:Seq:
        comment: |
          The class of ordered containers.  
          Whilst formally it is no different from an rdf:Bag or an rdf:Alt, the rdf:Seq class is used conventionally
          to indicate to a human reader that the numerical ordering of the container membership properties 
          of the container is intended to be significant.
        subclassOf: rdfs:Container
      rdf:Alt:
        comment: |
          the class of RDF 'Alternative' containers.  
          Whilst formally it is no different from an rdf:Seq or an rdf:Bag, the rdf:Alt class is used conventionally
          to indicate to a human reader that typical processing will be to select one of the members of the container.
          The first member of the container, i.e. the value of the rdf:_1 property, is the default choice.
      rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty:
        comment: |
          The class of container membership properties, rdf:_1, rdf:_2, ..., all of which are sub-properties of 'member'.
          Each instance of rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty is an rdfs:subPropertyOf the rdfs:member property.
        subclassOf: rdf:Property
      rdf:List:
        comment: The class of RDF Lists.
